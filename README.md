# csc190-beam-team

Team Beam Team's final project.

## Todo

### Sprint 00

<!-- This is just here in case your editor has a way to list local todos, this list is easily jumpable -->
<!-- TODO: List of todo items in the README.md-->

- Setup wiki for development log.
    - This is probably the best route unless you would like to statically generate our own website with some tool like [srid/emanote](https://github.com/srid/emanote) or its predecessor [srid/neuron] (which I only recommend due to experiences, !!!suggestions welcome!!!)

## Stack proposal

Hello Beam Team, **we are going to need a stack.** Place personal recommendations here. All proposals will get equal consideration, though this is more of a list of tools we could be using due to us likely have to adhere to customers spec. Please follow the provided syntax below. Each proposal must have a **link to the project** and a ***short*** **elevator pitch**. Let's get some cool ideas going.

```
- Category of tool
    - <[linkTo/project-repo](https://github.com/LinkTo/project-repo.git)>
        - <Elevator Pitch>
        - <Optional: Links to cool documentation, examples, or anything else you coul want to expand. Useful learning resources will be cherished>
```
### Team Management

- Shared Configuration Standard
    - [editorconfig/editorconfig](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig)
        - Universal editor configuration for uniform editor settings for things like spaces, character sets, indention style, and more

### Node Based Web Stack
