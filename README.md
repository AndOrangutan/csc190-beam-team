## The Goal

Create a mobile application for the American River Parkway Foundation
that provides users with a user-friendly and convenient way to access information about the
Foundation and the American River Parkway. The mobile app will include a map feature,
allowing users to easily locate and explore different areas of the parkway. The app will provide
users with a wealth of information about the parkway, including trails, natural features, historical
landmarks, and events. By creating a mobile app, the American River Parkway Foundation
hopes to increase awareness and engagement among users, leading to increased support and
preservation of this important natural resource.

    - Languages: TailwindCSS, Typescript, and React Native JSX
    - SKDs: Expo, with Xcode or Android Studio for emulation 
- Backend
    - Server: Express JS
- Database 
    - Postgresql provided thorugh Supabase
- APIâ€™s

## Environment Setup

Requirements:

- Node.js
    - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
    - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Yarn
    - This is basically a dorp in replacement for the `npm` command
    - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install
- Android emulator via Android Studio or iOS simulator from Xcode
    - https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-install-android-studio#0
    - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/installing-xcode-and-simulators
    - This seems like a decent video (just watch what partains to your needs) https://youtu.be/0-S5a0eXPoc

VSCode plugins you'll probably want:

- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
- https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint

### Download and Initialization

1. Clone the codebase from the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndOrangutan/csc190-beam-team
```

2. Add in `.env` environmental variable file to the root file directory, providing API Keys, IP, and Port.

```bash
code .env   # Create .env file and open it in vscode.
```

3. Initialize the project, this installs the required libraries and builds the project (basically `yarn install` and `yarn run build` for both server and 
client)
    - Windows
        ```bash
        ./init.bat
        ```

    - Linux or MacOS
        ```bash
        ./init.sh
        ```

4. Run the server from a terminal:

```bash
cd server
yarn run start
```

If you have made changes to the server, you will have to rebuild first running the following in the server directory:

```bash
yarn run build
```

5. Open another terminal to the ROOT of the project and run the client:

```bash
yarn run start
```

6. From here you should be prompted to open the app in an iOS Sim or Android Emulator.


### Testing

Running test for the client can simply be done by calling:

```bash
yarn test
```

To run the server's, first change into the server directory.

```bash
cd server
yarn test
```
