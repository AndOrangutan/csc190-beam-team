## The Goal
Create a mobile application for the American River Parkway Foundation
that provides users with a user-friendly and convenient way to access information about the
Foundation and the American River Parkway. The mobile app will include a map feature,
allowing users to easily locate and explore different areas of the parkway. The app will provide
users with a wealth of information about the parkway, including trails, natural features, historical
landmarks, and events. By creating a mobile app, the American River Parkway Foundation
hopes to increase awareness and engagement among users, leading to increased support and
preservation of this important natural resource.

### Testing


### Environment Setup

- Install Node.js
    - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
    - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Install Yarn
    - This is basically a dorp in replacement for the `npm` command
    - https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install
- Get your android emulator or ios simulator setup
    - This seems like a decent video (just watch what partains to your needs) https://youtu.be/0-S5a0eXPoc
- VSCode plugins you'll probably want
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=byCedric.vscode-expo

- You can clone it just as you would any project, I like bare repos with worktrees, but a standard repo will work.
    - `git clone --bare https://github.com/AndOrangutan/csc190-beam-team csc190-beam-team`
    - `git worktree add main`
    - `cd main`
    - Another branch
    - `git worketree add ../<branch-name>`
    - `cd ../<branch-name>`
